                        <br>
                        This text based adventure is based in C++. Originally devloped to demonstrate knowledge of 'if' statements, it was expended to use indirect 
                        referencing of structures and strings. Due to limited time, only 4 saltsketeers are supported, with 8 desert creatures, 8 potions, And
                        8 miscelaneous items. However any number of characters and items could be implemented easily due to the game's flexible design. <br>
                        <br>
                        P.S.: The name and theme of the game was inspired by a typo. FYI.

                    The Mars Snowball Fight series is an exercise in C++ programing with SDL and sprite sheets. Controll can be with the arrow keys or a game control pad.

                    <br>
                    This is part two of the Mars series. It is a ground up rewrite of the SDL handling code originally used for the Mars Snowball Fight.
                    Although more flexible and expandable than its predicessor, the rewrite lead to a time overrun and the game was not fully functional.
