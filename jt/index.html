            Hi, welcome to my little spot in the world. Here is where I bare my Soul!<br>
            <br>
            Ha! jokes on you. Being a ginger I don't have a soul. So I'm not burdened by such trivialities. <br>
            I do however have a bottle of SPF 60 suntan lotion in every vehicle I own. <br>
            <br>
            I guess you take the good with the bad.<br>
            <br>
            But you're not here to read about my existenctial crisis, or skin issues. Your here to find out what I can do. <br>
            Fortunately that's quit a bit. It use to be more, but hey, life is like that. What can I say; "I'm working on it!" <br>
            <br>
            In the meantime, enjoy the show. <br>
        </p>
