                The saltsketeers are a not so merry band of adventurers that are out to get the job done.
                 What that job is? and why? ...umm, ...well, nobody really stopped to ask that, but they are certainly doing it.
                 Don't worry though, what they lack in direction, and style, and sense of humour, they make up for with tenasity <br>

                 and find the best that 8-bit has to offer. The Sy_Pathetic gang are half game players, half game reviewers, 
                 and half game hecklers. What does that add up to? A big mess and a lot of fun. <br>
